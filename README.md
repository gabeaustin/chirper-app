# Chirper (Front End)

In this lab, you will be building your first front-end application using ReactJS.

It's called Chirper, a platform where you can post short messages on the internet for all the world to see!

## Instructions
* Your objective should be to create a "timeline" of Chirps -- short messages that you post on the Chirper platform.

* Your timeline should load with at least three chirps.

* Code a form with at least two inputs where users can submit new chirps from.

* When a new chirp is submitted it should be shown back to the user in the timeline.

* **HINT**: Don't try and code multiple components if you don't feel confident yet. Focus on building the entire functionality of this lab in a singular ``App.jsx`` file and then break it apart into smaller component files once you do so.

* **HINT**: This lab will require array manipulation with React's immutable state. You may need to do some Google detective work to see how React state and arrays work together when "updating" them with new values.

## Advanced (optional)
* Look into the npm packages of ``uuid`` for generating unique keys for each chirp, ``moment`` for nicely formatting timestamps for each chirp, and ``react-icons`` to add some SVG icons to really add that cool style to your Chirper lab.
